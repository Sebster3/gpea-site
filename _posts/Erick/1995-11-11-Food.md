Food purchased for the house should only be consumed during group meals. Personal food/snacks may be purchased as long as there is space in the fridge and it is labeled yours. Food may only be labled yours if it was purchased wholy with your own money.

Expired food will be discarded __immediately__.

Substantial portions of leftovers may be kept for 2 days. Personal-sized portions of leftovers may be kept for 1 day. Portions that are too small will be tossed to save fridge space.

If it is not labeled as yours then it is _free game_.
